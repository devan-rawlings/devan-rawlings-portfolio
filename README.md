This repository contains coding samples of my empirical research work in Economics. 
A few of the corresponding research papers are available on my website: http://www.devanrawlings.com

Available Projects:

1. canadian-rust-belt

This project contains all data cleaning, construction and analysis for my M.A. thesis, 
"Interrogating the Canadian Rust Belt: The Impacts of Manufacturing Decline on Labor Oucomes in the Twenty-First Century."

The paper draws from Canadian Census public-use microdata files (PUMFs) and aggregate data scraped from various Statistics Canada data products to contruct two
CMA/CA-level panel datasets, the 'NOC set' and 'NAICS set', respectively. I estimate the impact of a decline in manufacturing employment share across Canadian
cities and towns on changes in unemployment rates and wages among four sex-education groups 
(males and females; more than a college degree and less than a college degree) over 2001-2016. I use two different Bartik instrument identification strategies:
One that exploits the variation in the occupational composition of Canadian cities and towns' manufacturing industries (by NOC); and one that exploits the variation
in subindustrial composition (by NAICS). I also use the Bartik weight framework from Goldsmith-Pinkham et al. (2020) to test the identification of my strategies 
and identify the occupations and subindustries that explain most of the damage that manufacturing decline has done to local Canadian labor markets.

The corresponding paper is available on my website.

2. covid-restriction-labor

This project contains all data cleaning and analysis for my current independent project.

This paper draws from US CPS microdata and OxGRT COVID-19 restriction stringency data to estimate the impact of restriction stringency on unemployment rates,
job vacancy rates and labor tightness at the state level over the full 2020-2021 period. All of my analysis is complete and present on this repo; however,
the paper is currently in the drafting phase. Thus, only a brief proposal for the project is available on my website.
